## Assessment Key

* A = Acceptable
* U = Unacceptable

## Categories of Conduct

## Overall Conduct

  This section defines how each team member should and should not act while
  participating in CMPSC 101 course during Fall 2020. Everyone is
  required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight
  sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that
  members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender, as learners. This
  is a course in which individuals have different skillsets and different
  levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a class member
  for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other
  people's work is a core part of learning  how to learn and code effectively, yet when
  used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their
  permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact
  learning success. Therefore, members of this course should adhere to
  Allegheny's honor code for all submitted work.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Show respect for all peers as learners and team members
    * Allow peers to voice their opinions and questions
    * Read, understand, and follow all parts of this code of Conduct
    * Follow the honor code on all submitted work
    * Engage respectfully with peers’ ideas and questions.

  * Members shall not
    * Disrespect peers because of their race, gender identity, or sexuality

## Team Work

Some of the class activities and lab projects will require team collaboration.
This section of the Code of Conduct will provide guidance on effective and
inclusive team work.

### Participation

Every class member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the
class activities and lab projects at hand. This will ensure the
flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts in a respectful manner. Our learning
environment at its root includes participation, candidness
and insightful collaboration. Participating in team-based project discussion means
engaging in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and
truly be all there.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Respond quickly in Slack to clarify confusing issues or assist other colleagues
    * Value and consider everyone’s opinion
    * Be willing to meetup and work outside of class
    * Approach issues and team members with professionalism
    * Demonstrate continuous engagement with tasks
    * Be open minded
    * Raise a disagreeing opinion in a respectful manner
    * Be a contributing member in lab groups
    * Attend class sessions and be engaged during class
    * Be willing to help other classmates with problems they may have

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Demonstrate disrespect for team members
    * Have an inappropriate professional boundary with team members
    * Show poor participation and attitude to their lab delegated tasks
    * Demonstrate patterns of poor communication or little effort for
    collaboration in lab and Slack
    * Disrupt working teams' effectiveness by lack of collaboration
    * Attempt to dominate a lab discussions
    * Miss classes without a valid excuse
    * Refuse assistance from TLs or peers

### Decisions

The majority of individuals in a team should agree on a given decision before the
project is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows
that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision
it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should
reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine
how long a decision will take to implement.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Take into account everyone's input in the decision making process
    * Stay flexible and be willing to change if it would be productive
    * Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members
    * Record what choice was made and when it was implemented
    * Defer to the Professor or student technical leaders when unsure
    * Distribute tasks to all team members
    * A new decision should be made when a previous decision cannot be implemented
    * When a choice is disputed, use GitHub issue tracker and let team members
      share their opinion
    * Group members will agree on an allotted amount of time to respond to decision
      discussion. If a group member does not participate in the decision within
      allotted amount of time, their input is forfeited.

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Let an individual team member or a project manager make major decisions
    * Make decisions without finding evidence showing that it would likely be beneficial
    * Directly contradict the decision
    * Refuse to work on the decided option
    * Make decisions that would affect another team without first notifying them
    * Made decisions that unfairly burden one group member - to be determined by
      Professor or technical leaders in event of dispute


### Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the
project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful
and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great
insight in how to improve in future projects.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of
    the project
    * Come up with different approaches to solve issues with the project
    * Participate in the discussions in a respectful and courteous manner
    while adhering to the communications section of the code of conduct
    * Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    * Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve
    future projects and assignments
    * Provide feedback on aspects of the project that were particularly effective and should be used in the future


* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Insult others while presenting criticism
    * Blame other members for any issues with the final product
    * Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues
    * Refuse to attend meetings associated with the product

### Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group.
It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a
professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful
    conversations
    * If conflicts become severe between class members, they should be brought
    to the attention of the project managers who will work to resolve any issues
    * Project managers, technical leaders and the course instructor are
    responsible for resolving any issues by proposing solutions to reach a
    compromise between class members involved
    * Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a
    conflict
    * The course instructor has a final say in how severe conflicts
    should be resolved
    * Be respectful and open-minded with everybody in the team when
    encountering a conflict
    * Remain professional even when working with someone you do not get along with
    * Always show respect

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Encourage or engage in conflicts that undermine the code
    of conduct
    * Escalate existing conflicts that jeopardize the group project
    * Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict
    that has been brought to their attention
    * Talk about classmates behind their back

## Infractions

An infraction occurs when class member(s) violate the agreed
rules present in the code of conduct. Any action
that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an
infraction. Class member(s) should avoid infractions since the accumulation of
them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of
previous infractions. Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher
level infraction and thus a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the Allegheny College Honor code
guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all students in Allegheny College and
is enforced by the college's Honor Committee, this code of conduct only
includes members of the Data Abstraction class for the Fall semester
of 2020.

* *Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*
  * Level I: Any violation of a code of conduct rule is by default a Level I
  infraction. Technical leaders and instructor will be
  keeping track of infractions.
    * A warning will be issued to the student accused of violating the code of conduct. Work completed involving the infraction will have to be redone. If another student was the victim as a result of the code’s infraction, an apology must be given.
  * Level II: Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, project
  managers and the instructor will issue a formal level II infraction.
    * The student will lose any points or credit that would have been received from work completed involving the infractions.
  * Level III: A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has
  accumulated five Level I infractions.
    * The class instructor will determine the severity of the infractions and develop a fair means of action, either against the student’s grade in the class, or that the student must accomplish to make amends for their infractions of the code of conduct.

Class member(s) are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure
a safe, inclusive and collegial environment.

Class member(s) may appeal any infraction to the instructor of the class.
Any decision made by the instructor for the given infraction(s) will be final.
