## Summary

This repository contains the template for the code of conduct in [Computer Science 101 Fall
2020](https://cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/teaching/101). The class will
collaboratively improve and add missing details to the template to develop a
completed and comprehensive code of conduct. The instructor and students will
then use this conduct guide to govern all course interactions.

## Objectives

* To develop a code of conduct governing how all members of Data Abstraction class will interact during class, lab and practical sessions, as well as when working in a team.

* To learn how to use GitHub and the GitHub Flow model to support collaboration among a team of software engineers.

* To learn how to use Markdown to complete technical writing tasks.

## Reading Assignment

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In  particular,  please  make  sure  that  you  have  read
guides  such  as  "Mastering  Markdown"  and "Documenting Your Projects on GitHub";
each of them will help you to understand how to use both GitHub and GitHub Classroom.
You are also expected to read [ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).
Please see the course instructor if you have questions on these reading assignments.

## Creating the Code of Conduct Guide

### Accessing the Repository

Unlike all subsequent assignments, where you will be invited to use a provided
GitHub Classroom link to create your own copy of the starter repository, in this
lab all class members are going to work in the same
[lab 01 repository](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-101-f2020/lab01-cs101f2020) following
[GitHub flow model](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) to collaboratively improve
the conduct guide.

### Tasks

For this laboratory assignment,  your  task  is  to  collaborate  with  the
members  of  your  class  to  write  a  full-featured code of conduct, using
the GitHub Flow model to facilitate collaboration. You should first read the
[ACM's Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) that all computer
scientists are expected to follow. Using this broad standard as the baseline,
you should then describe specific student and instructor behaviors
that are deemed to be acceptable and unacceptable in this course.
Make sure that you explain how the class will handle infractions of the conduct
guide.

Please note that you should use repository forks or branches and pull requests
to ensure that your  work  is  ultimately  added  to  the  repository's  master
branch.   When  you  follow  the  GitHub Flow model you should create a separate
"feature branch" in your GitHub repository that contains additions or changes
that you want to make to the code of conduct.  Using appropriate commit messages,
you will repeatedly commit to this branch until you have finished the feature.  Now, you
will  use  GitHub  to  raise  a  pull  request,  tagging  the  course  instructor
and  the  student  technical leaders and asking them review your work.
Once you have resolved all of the concerns raised by the reviewers of your pull
request and it is approved, a  member  of  your  team  should  merge  it  into
the  master  branch  of  the  GitHub  repository.   At this point,  you can
delete the feature branch from the repository and start working on the next
task associated with completing this project.

### Team Work

Each member of the class will be randomly assigned to a team at the beginning
of the lab session. Each team will be assigned one feature/section to start
with. All teams are expected to make contributions to all sections of the conduct
guide.

Your team should use GitHub and its features (e.g., issue tracker, pull requests,
commit log, and code review request) to complete all of the tasks referenced in
the previous section.  Aiming to manage risk and estimate the effort required for
individual team members to complete this project, you should assign people to
teams, roles, and tasks.  While it is acceptable for you to have Zoom
discussions with your team members or to talk about the project through Slack,
please remember that all important discussions and decisions must be also
documented through GitHub.

Since  multiple  approaches  may  support  the  effective  completion  of  the
required  documents, this assignment does not dictate team organization or
communication strategies.  The students in the course should instead work
with each other, the student technical leaders, and the instructor to identify
team roles and strategies for effective organization and communication.
Importantly, you should make sure that every student in the class makes a
contribution to the code of conduct GitHub repository.  By the end of the
laboratory session, the team should have identified roles for each student
in the class, thus ensuring that everyone has assigned tasks that will both
capitalize on their expertise and enhance their software engineering skills.
Please remember that GitHub Actions CI is configured to check the Markdown files in
the repository with "mdl".  If your writing meets all the established requirements
set by this linting tools, then you will see a green :heavy_check_mark: in the listing of
commits in GitHub after awhile.  If your submission does not meet the requirements,
a red :heavy_multiplication_x: will appear instead.  The instructor will assign
your grade as a checkmark grade (0/1) for this lab; you will receive 1 if you
contributed to the GitHub repository, your team made a pull request including
your contributions, and it was accepted by the instructor and technical leaders,
otherwise you will receive a 0.

## Problems with the Conduct Guide
